I am the head of Artificial intelligence at Drone Volt, Expert in onboard artificial intelligence and professional civilian drone manufacturer. I hold a Ph.D. in Signal and image processing from Paris-Saclay University. My fields of expertise include machine learning, computer vision, Signal & Image processing and data science in general. Iâ€™m a learner for life, my goal is to increase the variance of my knowledge distribution. I enjoy mentoring and transfer my knowledge to others, hence, I write articles about what I think will help people out there. The articles I write are high to moderately technical. I try to do my best to make it easy and practical. I like working in an agile environment and enjoy high-pace work with the mindset of adding values to the business.
