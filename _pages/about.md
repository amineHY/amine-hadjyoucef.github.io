**Bio**
Coming soon
<!-- I am the Director of AI at Tesla, where I lead the team responsible for all neural networks on the Autopilot. Previously, I was a Research Scientist at OpenAI working on Deep Learning in Computer Vision, Generative Modeling and Reinforcement Learning. I received my PhD from Stanford, where I worked with Fei-Fei Li on Convolutional/Recurrent Neural Network architectures and their applications in Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing and their intersection. Over the course of my PhD I squeezed in two internships at Google where I worked on large-scale feature learning over YouTube videos, and in 2015 I interned at DeepMind and worked on Deep Reinforcement Learning. Together with Fei-Fei, I designed and taught a new Stanford class on Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition (CS231n). The class was the first Deep Learning course offering at Stanford and has grown from 150 enrolled in 2015 to 330 students in 2016, and 750 students in 2017. -->

<!-- On a side for fun I blog, tweet, and maintain several Deep Learning libraries written in Javascript (e.g. ConvNetJS, RecurrentJS, REINFORCEjs, t-sneJS). I am also sometimes jokingly referred to as the reference human for ImageNet (post :)). I also recently expanded on this with arxiv-sanity.com, which lets you search and sort through ~30,000 Arxiv papers on Machine Learning over the last 3 years in the same pretty format. -->
