\textbf{Dates:} 02/2012 - 02/2013

\textbf{Description}\\
As part of the internship at the end of engineering studies, I held the
position of machine learning engineer for the EEG biomedical signal
epilepsy detection project. The goal is to anticipate the treatment of
the pathology, and protect the individual suffering from the pathology
in case of epileptic seizure.

\textbf{Accomplishments}\\
► Developed project management skills through the development of a
decision support tool for epilepsy detection from an EEG signals
database using machine learning, resulting in the proposition of a new
pipeline for the classification of biomedical signals in Matlab

► Improved writing and communication skills through writing papers,
leading to 2 publications in international conferences

► Ability to successfully handle a research project in machine learning
