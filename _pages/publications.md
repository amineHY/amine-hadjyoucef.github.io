description de la publicationIn this paper we propose an approach of image
restoration from multispectral data provided by an imaging
system. We specifically address two topics: (i) Development of
a multi-wavelength direct model for non-stationary instrument
response that includes a spatial convolution and a spectral
integration, (ii) Implementation of multispectral image
restoration using a regularized least-square, based on a
quadratic criterion and minimized by a gradient algorithm.
We test our approach on simulated data of the Mid-InfraRed
Instrument IMager (MIRIM) of the James Webb Space
Telescope (JWST). Our method shows a clear increase of spatial
resolution compare to conventional methods.
